4,"Kinton Ramen is a great spot in downtown. We ordered the 4 person combo for $83 and it was almost worth the price. I will say the gyozas, as good as they were, was on the smaller side for 4 people which was unfortunate because they were sooo good. The fries were perfectly crispy, and the ramen itself was really good. I do love spice, so they didn’t have many options to make it spicier, which is fine, i still enjoyed it. I’m a vegetarian and there’s few vegetarian options here and this one was perfect. had 4 different options which i loved. Will be back!",Lunch,0.41862745098039217,positive,positive,True

5,"My first experience with Kinton, a national chain, was back on March 31st when I had what stands to this day as the best Ramen I've ever had.  Unfortunately for me, it was a seasonal feature. Fingers crossed it comes back next year and I will salivate in the mean time. It was the Burnt Shoyu Ramen.

In June of this year, I decided that I deserved more Ramen and made a weekly routine to go for Ramen on my Friday.  Since then, I have returned weekly (missed 1 week cuz vacation). I've endeavored to try a different one every week. I've had the Pork, Chicken, and Beef Original. I've tried the Pork Miso, the Spicy Garlic Chicken (garlic on the side), and the seasonal Chilled Tsukemen. I went with the Spicy Garlic on my second last visit because I kept seeing others order it and was curios why it was seemingly popular. It was the first time I didn't finish the broth as it was too spicy for me. Still very tasty. All have been great, but the Beef Original I had on my most recent visit is definitely my new favorite and I fear I will just have it as a go to and stop trying new items. Variety is the spice (no pun intended) of life!

As for the staff, extremely kind, friendly, efficient, respectful, attentive and competent!  Keep up the excellent work!

Value for your bucks?  By far the best in this category! Plus, they have a stamp card, if you ask, which will get you perks. Win Win!

Excellent ramen and among the best I can remember having.

Vibrant interior, small, with maybe 8 tables. Seats are hard but not uncomfortable. They are small, however, and if we had to pick on something, this would be it. We aren't big people, and we could see how this might be a problem for larger folks. Also tables seemed a tad crammed together. Service here is fantastic and quick.

We got the following:

Meal for two (39.99 Canadian): This comes with two ramen,  an order of pork/veggie Gyozas (4), and two drinks. We got Beef Miso and Beef Spicy Garlic for our ramen. Both are hearty with noodles. Excellent broth, and the spicy broth has some good heat. Both reorders. The Gyoza (pork) was so good that we ordered another round. Slight crisp outside and scrumptious interior. Comes with a sweet sauce, good, but these are excellent in themselves. We got their homemade lemonade as drinks. Pulp throughout and not overly sweet as you may get elsewhere. Good version.

Meal for one (22.99 Canadian): Comes with one ramen, an order of pork/veggie Gyoza (4), and a drink. Did Chicken Original as the ramen here. Not overly salty broth with a hearty amount of noodles and stuff. Good version.

The Spicy Garlic Beef ramen and the pork Gyoza stick out to us as clear favorites.

You get chopsticks, and your ramen comes with the large ladle/spoon that is typical.

We thoroughly enjoyed our meal",Dinner,0.2859447004608295,positive,positive,True

4,"Overall, it’s a solid place for getting authentic Japanese food. If you come during the summer, I recommend the combo with original broth ramen + gyozas + a drink for only $15.99.

SERVICE: Pretty good. The servers were kind.

ATMOSPHERE: It is a pretty small and closed in restaurant. Bonus points for there being an open kitchen, so you can see the chefs make your dish.

FOOD: Great! I ordered the original broth with pork and gyozas (the gyoza, original broth ramen, and a drink was a really good deal - only $15.99). My friend ordered the Pork Spicy Garlic. The gyozas were nice and crispy, and the filling was good too. The original broth ramen was also delicious, and the portion size is pretty good.

4,"Tried the Beef Original and Meal for One set today. Overall, both noodle bowls had rich and flavourful broth. The Beef Original had a nice balance of beef and pepper – the pepper added depth without overpowering the beef. The noodles were cooked perfectly, showing the chef’s attention to detail. The beef was tender and juicy, with the fat melting in your mouth. The chicken, on the other hand, was chicken breast, so it was expectedly a bit dry and chewy. Still, the meal was definitely worth coming back for.

The only odd part was the service.

1. I started eating around 1:30 p.m., and there were still three empty tables. As soon as I finished one item, the server immediately came to take away the bowl – it felt a bit rushed.

2. I was sitting at the bar, and a staff member was seated next to me. After she closed her laptop rather loudly, I glanced over. Unexpectedly, she gave me a sharp, unfriendly glare. Since I was sitting quite close to the kitchen, I felt a little uneasy and didn’t dare to look again.

Great food overall, but the service made the experience a bit uncomfortable.",Lunch,0.05416666666666666,neutral,positive,False

The prices is reasonable for dinner for 2 for $41.99 plus 2 drinks and choice between gyoza (pork or veggie) or Tokyo Fries.

Gyoza is good. Nice and tangy sauce. Perfect bite and filling is seasoned well.

I ordered pork spicy garlic ramen with thick noodles. Noodles was really good as it has that nice chewy texture and you can slurp the noodles up. The soup is really good with the garlic (freshly grated). Hearty soup has the perfect amount of spicy kick.

I like the soup so much that I drank all of it. This is the 2nd place that I drank the entire soup. The 1st place is at a Vietnamese restaurant in Edmonton.

A handful of things ruffled my feathers:
-portion was about 15% smaller than most ramen places
-i get salty when ramen costs more than $20. i get that post-pandemic vancouver demands these prices, especially on this part of robson street.
-it’s repugnant and deplorable when businesses offer discounts or freebies for 5-star ratings on google. Totally undermines the rating system and makes it useless. It’s a double shame, because they genuinely have 5-star food.
-in the year 2025, they have a physical stamp card, and it only gets you gyoza after 10 ramens.

I wonder if I can ask for less spice next time. One of their chashu is torched, and the other one isn't, but both are soft. I found out that their original shio tonkotsu version includes an egg, so that is a good incentive to try that one next time!

5,"I went to Kinton Ramen Robson on March 29th for their special promotion dinner. I was deeply moved by the restaurant’s principles, delicious food, and attentive service. There was a long line outside, and a woman in front of me let two friends (a man and a woman) cut in line to join her. Shortly after, two more men arrived, making it a total of four people cutting in. I and the customers behind me expressed our dissatisfaction. The male server consulted the manager and then informed the group that their behavior was not acceptable, leading them to leave.

Near the end of my meal, the same male server who resolved the issue asked me what flavor of cheesecake I would like. Only when I was almost done with my dessert did I realize—it was a complimentary treat from the restaurant to make up for the earlier unpleasantness! Both the ramen and the cake were incredibly delicious, and the cream that came with the cake was a healthy type that melts smoothly! The restaurant was full of Japanese spirit, with an energetic and orderly atmosphere. Everything was clean, fast, and well-organized, leaving me with a great impression and deep respect. This is definitely the best ramen shop in Greater Vancouver!

3月29日のKinton Ramen Robsonの特別プロモーション日に夕食を食べに行きました。このお店の理念、美味しさ、そして細やかで心のこもったサービスに感動しました。外には長い行列があり、私の前にいた女性が友人（男性1人、女性1人）を割り込ませました。その後、さらに2人の男性が到着し、合計4人が割り込みました。私と後ろのお客さんは不満を表しました。男性の店員さんがマネージャーに確認し、割り込みは認められないと伝えたため、彼らはそのまま去りました。

食事が終わりに近づいたとき、先ほど問題を解決してくれた男性店員が「どのチーズケーキの味が好きですか？」と聞いてくれました。ケーキを食べ終える頃になってようやく気づきました――これは、先ほどの出来事を補うためにお店がプレゼントしてくれたものだったのです！ラーメンもケーキもとても美味しく、ケーキのクリームは滑らかに溶けるヘルシーなものでした！店内は日本の精神が満ち溢れ、活気があり、清潔で整然としていて、素晴らしい印象と敬意を感じました。間違いなく、大バンクーバー地区で最高のラーメン店です！

我在 3 月 29 号去 Kinton Ramen Robson 吃特价促销日的晚餐。这家店的原则、美味和贴心细腻的服务让我感动不已。店外有一条很长的队伍，排在我前面的女士让她的一男一女两位朋友插队站到她身旁。不久后，又来了两位男士，总共有四个人插队。我和我身后的顾客对此表达了不满。店里的男服务生询问了经理的意见后，表示不支持这五个人的行为，他们最终集体离开了。

当我快吃完拉面时，刚才解决问题的男服务生问我想吃什么口味的芝士蛋糕。直到我快吃完蛋糕时，我才猛然意识到——这份蛋糕是店家为了补偿刚才的不快而赠送给我的！蛋糕和拉面都超级美味，而且蛋糕配的奶油是可以融化的健康奶油！店里的氛围充满了日本精神，大家都充满活力，一切都干净整洁、迅速而有序，给人一种极佳的体验和敬意。这绝对是大温地区最棒的拉面店！

Fui a cenar a Kinton Ramen Robson el 29 de marzo durante su promoción especial. Me emocionaron los principios del restaurante, la deliciosa comida y el servicio atento y detallado. Afuera había una fila larga, y la mujer delante de mí dejó que dos amigos (un hombre y una mujer) se colaran en la fila para unirse a ella. Poco después, llegaron dos hombres más, sumando un total de cuatro personas que se colaron. Los clientes detrás de mí y yo expresamos nuestro descontento. Un camarero consultó con el gerente y luego informó al grupo que su comportamiento no era aceptable, por lo que decidieron irse.

Cuando estaba por terminar mi ramen, el mismo camarero que resolvió el problema me preguntó qué sabor de cheesecake me gustaría. No me di cuenta hasta que casi terminé el pastel: ¡era un obsequio del restaurante para compensar la situación anterior! Tanto el ramen como el pastel estaban deliciosos, y la crema que acompañaba el pastel era una crema saludable que se derretía suavemente. El ambiente del restaurante reflejaba perfectamente el espíritu japonés, con una atmósfera llena de energía y orden. Todo estaba limpio, rápido y bien organizado, dejándome una gran impresión y profundo respeto. ¡Definitivamente el mejor restaurante de ramen en el área metropolitana de Vancouver!

当我食紧拉面尾声时，之前帮我哋解决问题嗰位男店员问我想要咩味道嘅芝士蛋糕。直到食到差唔多完，我先醒起——呢份蛋糕係店家送畀我，补偿之前嘅不愉快！蛋糕同拉面都超级好味，而且蛋糕配搭嘅奶油係健康、可以慢慢溶化嘅！店内氛围充满日本精神，所有员工都充满活力，一切整洁快速而有秩序，令我充满好感同敬意。呢间绝对係大温地区最正嘅拉面店！",Dinner,0.23277529761904764,positive,positive,True
